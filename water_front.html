            <p>Vancouver’s Waterfront Park is a 35-acer swath of prime riverfront real estate that has passed through many hands throughout Vancouver’s history. It has been home to shipyards, a lumber mill and most recently Boise Cascade Paper Mill that closed in 2006. The land, for more than a century had been inaccessible to the public. In 2014 the city dug under existing railroad tracks, at the cost of $45 million dollars. This paved the way for the waterfront project. Many of downtowns local shops as well as Esther Short Park and the Saturday Market have become destinations for both visitors and residents. The new public access to the waterfront is a short 5-minute walk to the heart of downtown Vancouver, and a 10-minute drive to downtown Portland.</p>
