- Block 10 is an undeveloped block in the middle of downtown. It stand out as a large undeveloped block surrounded by large buildings. It is just under an acre in size. There have been several proposal for developing block 10 but none of them have happened yet. Negotiations for the current plan began in April of 2017.

-The plan proposed by Gramor Development (include a link) will develop a 250 unit apartment building with a 30,000 foot grocery store at the ground floor. PArking will be provided obth above ground and underground. The city is also interested in developing a public school on the lot.

-The block as bought by the city of vanocuver from General BRweing company in 94. he city demolished all the buildings on the lot and put up a fence to prevent anybody from entering the lot. in 2012 voters agreed to spend 20,000 to change the empty lot into a very baren park. They planted flowers and brought in gravel for walkways. In 2013 the fence was removed it became a park. Since then it has been an oddly ugly park in the middle of downtown.
