            <h2>Downtown Vancouver's Block 10</h2>
            <article>
                <div id="block10Img"></div>
                <p class="block10P">Block 10 is an undeveloped block in the middle of downtown Vancouver. It stands out as a large   undeveloped block in downtown that is surrounded by large buildings. The block is just under an acre in size. There have been several proposals for developing block 10. None of the proposals have been approved for construction. Negotiations for the current plan began in April of 2017.
                </p>
                <p class="block10P">The plan proposed by Gramor Development will develop a 250-unit apartment building with a 30,000-foot grocery store at the ground floor. Parking will be provided both above ground and underground. The city is also interested in developing a public school on the lot.
                </p>
                <p class="block10P">An analysis shows that downtown Vancouver in a grocery store desert. It is rare for a region with so such high population density, and such high median income, will be without a major grocery store. The closest grocery store to Block 10 is the Safeway on 37th Street. This Safeway is not considered a full sized grocery store either. </p>
                <p class="block10P">The block was bought by the city of Vancouver from General Brewing company in 94. The city demolished all the buildings on the lot and put up a fence to prevent anybody from entering the lot. In 2012 voters agreed to spend $20,000 to change the empty lot into a very barren park. Workers planted flowers and brought in gravel for walkways. In 2013 the fence that prevented access to the park was removed Block 10 became a city park. Since then it has been an oddly ugly park in the middle of downtown.
